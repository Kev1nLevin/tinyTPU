PreRoute RC Extraction called for design systolic_top_ARRAY_SIZE8.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.
Type 'man IMPEXT-6197' for more detail.

Extraction called for design 'systolic_top_ARRAY_SIZE8' of instances=33504 and nets=36485 using extraction engine 'preRoute' .
PreRoute RC Extraction called for design systolic_top_ARRAY_SIZE8.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.
Type 'man IMPEXT-6197' for more detail.

PreRoute RC Extraction called for design systolic_top_ARRAY_SIZE8.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.

**WARN: (IMPEXT-3518):	The lower process node is set (using command 'setDesignMode') but the technology file for TQuantus extraction not specified. Therefore, going for postRoute (effortLevel low) extraction instead of recommended extractor 'TQuantus' for lower nodes. Use command 'set_analysis_view/update_rc_corner' to specify the technology file for TQuantus extraction to take place.
Extraction called for design 'systolic_top_ARRAY_SIZE8' of instances=33560 and nets=36541 using extraction engine 'postRoute' at effort level 'low' .
PostRoute (effortLevel low) RC Extraction called for design systolic_top_ARRAY_SIZE8.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.

**WARN: (SDF-808):	The software is currently operating in a high performance mode which optimizes the handling of multiple timing arcs between input and output pin pairs. With the current settings, the SDF file generated will contain the same delay information for all of these arcs. To have the SDF recalculated with explicit pin pair data, you should use the option '-recompute_delay_calc'. This setting is recommended for generating SDF for functional  simulation applications.

**WARN: (IMPEXT-3518):	The lower process node is set (using command 'setDesignMode') but the technology file for TQuantus extraction not specified. Therefore, going for postRoute (effortLevel low) extraction instead of recommended extractor 'TQuantus' for lower nodes. Use command 'set_analysis_view/update_rc_corner' to specify the technology file for TQuantus extraction to take place.
Extraction called for design 'systolic_top_ARRAY_SIZE8' of instances=82215 and nets=36541 using extraction engine 'postRoute' at effort level 'low' .
PostRoute (effortLevel low) RC Extraction called for design systolic_top_ARRAY_SIZE8.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.
Type 'man IMPEXT-6197' for more detail.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-3032):	Because the cap table file was not provided, it will be created internally with the following process info:
